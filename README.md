# -cerebellar-model-arithmetic-computer-CMAC-
 cerebellar model arithmetic computer which is a type of neural network based on a model of the mammalian cerebellum.
Here I have programd a discrete CMAC and and contineous CMAC, which is  then trained on a 1-D function base on the refrence from Albus 1975 research paper, in order to explore effect of overlap area on generalization and time to convergence.I have made use of 35 weights for my CMAC and sampled my function at 100 evenly spaced points. Made use of 70 for training and 30 for testing. And alt last reported the accuracy of CMAC network using only the 30 test points.
